        <font color="green"><i> <em>Field Hockey is a popular sport in India.</em> Until the mid-1970s, India men's team dominated international field hockey, winning 7 Olympic gold medals and won the 1975 Men's Hockey World Cup. Since then, barring a gold medal at the 1980 Olympics,
                    India's performance in field hockey has been dismal, with other hockey-playing nations such as Australia, Netherlands and Germany improving their standards and catching up with India. Its decline is also due to the change in rules of the game,
                    introduction of artificial turf, and internal politics in Indian field hockey bodies. The popularity of field hockey has also declined massively parallel to the decline of the Indian hockey team. In recent years, the standard of Indian hockey
                    has gone from bad to worse, with the Men's team not qualifying for the 2008 Olympics and finishing last in the 2012 Olympics. Since 2014, the men's team is trying to regain its lost glory little by little as they become runners up at the 2014
                    Commonwealth Games, then winning a much needed 2014 Asian Games </br>gold and 2017 Men's Hockey Asia Cup to finally establishing the Asian dominance after long time but before that India lost to Belgium in the quarter final of 2016 Rio Olympics.
                    India men's hockey team is eyeing gold at the 2018 Men's Hockey World Cup as it is going to hold in India, as support of home crowds which is a must need to defeat the aura of the Australians who constantly dominating the Indian team in the
                    recent years in various finals such as the 2014 & 2018 Hockey Champions Trophy. Currently, the Indian men's team is 5th in the rankings of the Fédération Internationale de Hockey sur Gazon (FIH, English:International Hockey Federation), the
                    international governing body of field hockey and indoor field hockey.[45] The Women's team came of age in 1980 when they first participated at the Summer Olympics and achieved the 4th place. The first golden moment for the team was in 1982
                    at the Asian Games. Since then not much of happening moments in the team history, though in 2016 after 34 years, it is a little hope when Indian women's team qualified for the Summer Olympics and they went on to win the 2017 Women's Hockey
                    Asia Cup claiming the <del>Asian dominance after 2004. India Women's team failed to win any medal in the Women's Hockey World Cup. The present team is ranked 10th by the Fédération Internationale de Hockey.[45] India has hosted three Men's Hockey
                    World Cups–one in 1982 in Mumbai, another in 2010 in Delhi, where they finished fifth and eighth respectively, and the third one at Bhubaneswar in 2018. India also hosted the annual Hockey Champions Trophy in 1996, 2005 2014 and 2016 Until

                    hockey called Hockey India (HI) was formed on 20 May 2009, with support from the IOA and former hockey players. HI, recognised by the International Hockey Federation (FIH), has the sole mandate to govern and conduct all activities for both
                    men's and women's field hockey in India. Although the IHF was reinstated in 2010,[46] it is not recognised by the FIH. The IHF conducts a franchise-based tournament called World Series Hockey (WSH), with its first season conducted in 2012.
                    However, it is not approved by HI or the FIH. HI also conducts a franchise-based tournament called the Hockey India League (HIL). Its first season was in 2013 and is inspired from the Board of Control for Cricket in India's (BCCI's) highly
                    successful Indian Premier League. The tournament is recognised by the FIH,
                     which has also decided to provide a 30-day window for the forthcoming seasons 
                     so that all top players can participate. </i></font>

        <h2>FOOT BALL</h2>
    </p>
    <font color="blue">
        <p><dfn>Football was introduced to India during the British colonial period.</dfn> Although India has never been represented in any FIFA World Cup, it did qualify in 1950, though it did not take part, as they were not allowed to play barefoot.[47]
            India was an Asian powerhouse in football in the 1950s and 1960s. During this golden era, India created history as the first Asian team to reach semi-finals in an Olympic football tournament in 1956 Summer Olympics at Melbourne and Neville
            D'Souza became the first Asian and Indian to score a hat-trick (record remains unbeaten) in an Olympic match.[48][49] India also finished as runners-up in the 1964 AFC Asian Cup. But later on, the standard of football started to decline due
            to lack of professionalism and fitness culture. India currently ranks 97th in the FIFA rankings as of 10 August 2017.[50] Football is, nevertheless, widely popular both as a spectator sport, and as a participation sport in some parts of the
            country such as Kerala, West Bengal, Goa and the Northeast. The India national football team represents India in all FIFA tournaments. The Yuva Bharati Krirangan of Kolkata was the second largest non-auto racing stadium in the world.[citation
            needed] In June 1937, at the Army Headquarters, Shimla, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) was formed at a meeting of the representatives of football associations of six regions where the game was very popular in those days. It is the
            governing body for football in India. Domestic competitions for men's football include the Indian Super League, I-League, I-League 2nd Division in the Indian League System and the annual knock-out style Federation Cup. For women's football
            the India women's football championship. However, it is European football, such as the English Premier League, Spanish La Liga, and the UEFA Champions League, which are very popular among Indian football fans, especially in metropolitan cities.[citation
            needed] FIFA revealed on 5 December 2013 (as part of their Executive Committee meets in Salvador, Brazil), that India would be the host of the 2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup, the 17th U-17 FIFA World Cup. This was the first international football
            competition at world level hosted by India. To help increase interest in youth football in advance of the 2017 U-17 World Cup, India launched the Mission XI Million programme.[citation needed] The matches were held from 6 to 28 October in
            the cities of New Delhi, Kolkata, Kochi, Navi Mumbai, Guwahati and Margao.[51]</font>

        <h2>TENNIS</h2>
    </p>
    <p>

        <font color="yellow">Tennis is a sport among Indians in urban areas. Tennis has gained popularity after exploits of Vijay Amritraj. India's fortunes in Grand Slam singles have been unimpressive, although Leander Paes won a singles bronze medal at the 1996 Olympics.
            Since the late 1990s India has had impressive results in Grand Slam doubles, Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi have won many men's doubles and mixed doubles Grand Slam titles. Sania Mirza is the most notable Indian woman tennis player, having
            won a WTA title and breaking into the Top 30 WTA rankings, also winning three Grand Slam doubles events, the first at Wimbledon in 2015. On the men's side, young Somdev Devvarman and Yuki Bhambri are flying India's flag on the ATP Tour. Yuki
            was the Australian Open junior singles champion in 2009. Rohan Bopanna has won two mixed doubles titles. </font>
