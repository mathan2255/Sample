            <font color="yellow"><s>Tennis is a sport among Indians in urban areas. Tennis has 
                    gained popularity after exploits of Vijay Amritraj. India's fortunes in Grand 
                    Slam singles have been unimpressive, although Leander Paes won a singles bronze 
                    medal at the 1996 Olympics.</s> <q>Since the late 1990s India has had impressive 
                        results in Grand Slam doubles, Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi have won many men's 
                        doubles and mixed doubles Grand Slam titles.</q> Sania Mirza is the most notable Indian woman tennis player, having won a WTA title and breaking into the Top 30 WTA rankings, also winning three Grand Slam doubles events, the first
                at Wimbledon in 2015. On the men's side, young Somdev Devvarman and Yuki Bhambri are flying India's flag on the ATP Tour. Yuki was the Australian Open junior singles champion in 2009. Rohan Bopanna has won two mixed doubles titles.
